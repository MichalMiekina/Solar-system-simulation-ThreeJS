Solar system simulation ThreeJS

Project needs to be uploaded at server if we want it be able to successively load textures.  
Server is not highly demanding, it is enough if we, for example, use any live coding extension for visual studio code.

Sliders are made to make it easier to animate, so user does not have to wait too long for venus rotation or earth orbiting the sun.
